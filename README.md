# Talkify
A javascript text to speech (TTS) library. Originally from and used by https://talkify.net.

Give a voice to your website in a matter of minutes. Talkify library provides you with high quality text to speech (TTS) voices in many languages.

## Important notice (14th Nov 2017)
Version 2.0.0 will require an api-key to use our backend services (our hosted voices). Visit our portal (https://manage.talkify.net) to create your own API-key, each key includes 1000 free requests per month. 

The old endpoints will be open for some period of time but are obsolete, this is to ensure that our current users will have time to fetch their own api-key. 

This change does not affect the browser-built-in voices, i.e. Html5Player, since they do not communicate with our backend service.

GPLv3

Please note that this library talks with a backend that is driven by personal fundings, therefore I intend to keep it free of charge until no longer possible. A rule of thumb: If you have a commersial product with heavy traffic, then a restriction or fee might be introduced to call the server.
